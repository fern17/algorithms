# algorithms
Algorithms written in modern C++ (C++17) following the book Introduction to Algorithms, from Thomas Cormen and others.

## Installation:
Just run CMake in the source folder and this will compile everything.

## Documentation:
Run Doxygen in folder documentation to obtain the HTML documentation.

## Tests: 
For now, the tests are done in the main method by just using each class or function. Later we will integrate GoogleTests.

## TODO: 
- [x] Create a simple project that uses this library to do something. That would force to make it usable.
- [x] integrate with Google Test and make every class test itself.
